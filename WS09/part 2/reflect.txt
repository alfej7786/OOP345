I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

For workshop 9, it was quite confusing for me, however after I read the note again, I find a way to solve the problem, but it still took time for me. I used bind in the findTreasure function to bind the arguments together. The bind is important in this workshop as we used multi-thread in it, and bind makes the calling easier. The advantage of multi-thread is that the same process can share the same memory, this means that will save the memory and spend less time.
