I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

The advantage of smart pointer is that you do not need to deal with the memory deallocation. The smart pointer would do it as soon as the smart pointer itself goes out of scope. The difference between raw and smart pointer sytax in my solution is that in the mergeRaw function, when using the raw pointer, I need to delete the memory manually. However, in the smart pointer, I do not need to deal with the memory.
